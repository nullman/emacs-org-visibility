  Org Visibility is an Emacs package that adds the ability to persist (save and
  load) the state of the visible sections of =org-mode= files. The state is
  automatically saved when the file is saved or killed, and restored when the
  file is loaded.

  Example Configuration:

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (use-package org-visibility
      :after (org)
      :demand t
      :bind* (:map org-visibility-mode-map
                   ("C-x C-v" . org-visibility-force-save) ; defaults to `find-alternative-file'
                   ("C-x M-v" . org-visibility-remove))    ; defaults to undefined
      :hook (org-mode . org-visibility-mode)
      :custom
      ;; list of directories and files to automatically persist and restore visibility state of
      (org-visibility-include-paths `(,(file-truename "~/.emacs.d/init-emacs.org")
                                      ,(file-truename "~/org")))
      ;; list of directories and files to not persist and restore visibility state of
      (org-visibility-exclude-paths `(,(file-truename "~/org/old")
                                      ,(file-truename "~/org/test"))))
  #+END_SRC

  Of course you will need to edit the above paths to match your setup.

  See the =Installation= and =Usage= parts of the =Commentary= section in
  [[file:org-visibility.el][org-visibility.el]] for more information and a full list of customizations.

  Emacs version 27.1 or later is required.

  Build with =make=.

  Clean with =make clean=.

  Run tests with =make test=.

  All files are generated from [[file:org-visibility.org][org-visibility.org]] using Emacs' org-mode literate
  programming system to "tangle" them.
