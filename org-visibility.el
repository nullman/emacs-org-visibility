;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Org Visibility is an Emacs package that adds the ability to persist (save
;; and load) the state of the visible sections of `org-mode' files. The state
;; is saved when the file is saved or killed, and restored when the file is
;; loaded.
;;
;; Hooks are used to persist and restore org tree visibility upon loading and
;; saving org files. Whether or not a given buffer's file will have its
;; visibility persisted is determined by the following logic:
;;
;; Qualification Rules:
;;
;; Files are only considered if their buffer is an `org-mode' buffer and they
;; meet one of the following requirements:
;;
;;   - File has buffer local variable `org-visibility' set to t
;;
;;   - File is contained within one of the directories listed in
;;     `org-visibility-include-paths'
;;
;;   - File path matches one of the regular expressions listed in
;;     `org-visibility-include-regexps'
;;
;; Files are removed from consideration if they meet one of the following
;; requirements (overriding the above include logic):
;;
;;   - File has buffer local variable `org-visibility' set to 'never
;;
;;   - File is contained within one of the directories listed in
;;     `org-visibility-exclude-paths'
;;
;;   - File matches one of the regular expressions listed in
;;     `org-visibility-exclude-regexps'.
;;
;; Provides the following interactive functions:
;;
;;   `org-visibility-save'             - Save visibility state for current buffer
;;   `org-visibility-force-save'       - Save even if buffer has not been modified
;;   `org-visibility-save-all-buffers' - Save all buffers that qualify
;;   `org-visibility-load'             - Load a file and restore its visibility state
;;   `org-visibility-remove'           - Remove current buffer from `org-visibility-state-file'
;;   `org-visibility-clean'            - Cleanup `org-visibility-state-file'
;;   `org-visibility-enable-hooks'     - Enable all hooks
;;   `org-visibility-disable-hooks'    - Disable all hooks
;;
;; Installation:
;;
;; Put `org-visibility.el' where you keep your elisp files and add something
;; like the following to your .emacs file:
;;
;;   ;; optionally change the location of the state file
;;   ;;(setq org-visibility-state-file `,(expand-file-name "/some/path/.org-visibility"))
;;
;;   ;; list of directories and files to persist and restore visibility state of
;;   (setq org-visibility-include-paths `(,(file-truename "~/.emacs.d/init-emacs.org")
;;                                        ,(file-truename "~/org"))
;;   ;; persist all org files regardless of location
;;   ;;(setq org-visibility-include-regexps '("\\.org\\'"))
;;
;;   ;; list of directories and files to not persist and restore visibility state of
;;   ;;(setq org-visibility-exclude-paths `(,(file-truename "~/org/old")))
;;
;;   ;; optionally set maximum number of files to keep track of
;;   ;; oldest files will be removed from the state file first
;;   ;;(setq org-visibility-maximum-tracked-files 100)
;;
;;   ;; optionally set maximum number of days (since saved) to keep track of
;;   ;; files older than this number of days will be removed from the state file
;;   ;;(setq org-visibility-maximum-tracked-days 180)
;;
;;   ;; optionally turn off visibility state change messages
;;   ;;(setq org-visibility-display-messages nil)
;;
;;   (require 'org-visibility)
;;
;;   ;; enable org-visibility-mode
;;   (org-visibility-mode 1)
;;
;;   ;; optionally set a keybinding to force save
;;   (bind-keys* :map org-visibility-mode-map
;;                    ("C-x C-v" . org-visibility-force-save) ; defaults to `find-alternative-file'
;;                    ("C-x M-v" . org-visibility-remove))    ; defaults to undefined
;;
;; Or, if using `use-package', add something like this instead:
;;
;;   (use-package org-visibility
;;     :after (org)
;;     :bind* (:map org-visibility-mode-map
;;                  ("C-x C-v" . org-visibility-force-save) ; defaults to `find-alternative-file'
;;                  ("C-x M-v" . org-visibility-remove))    ; defaults to undefined
;;     :custom

;;     ;;(org-visibility-state-file `,(expand-file-name "/some/path/.org-visibility"))
;;     ;; list of directories and files to persist and restore visibility state of
;;     (org-visibility-include-paths `(,(file-truename "~/.emacs.d/init-emacs.org")
;;                                     ,(file-truename "~/org")))
;;     ;; persist all org files regardless of location
;;     ;;(org-visibility-include-regexps '("\\.org\\'"))
;;     ;; list of directories and files to not persist and restore visibility state of
;;     ;;(org-visibility-exclude-paths `(,(file-truename "~/org/old")))
;;     ;; optionally set maximum number of files to keep track of
;;     ;; oldest files will be removed from the state file first
;;     ;;(org-visibility-maximum-tracked-files 100)
;;     ;; optionally set maximum number of days (since saved) to keep track of
;;     ;; files older than this number of days will be removed from the state file
;;     ;;(org-visibility-maximum-tracked-days 180)
;;     ;; optionally turn off visibility state change messages
;;     ;;(org-visibility-display-messages nil)
;;     :init
;;     (org-visibility-mode 1))
;;
;; Usage:
;;
;; As long as `org-visibility-mode' is enabled, visibility state is
;; automatically persisted on file save or kill, and restored when loaded. No
;; user intervention is needed. The user can, however, call
;; `org-visibility-force-save' to save the current visibility state of a
;; buffer before a file save or kill would automatically trigger it next.
;;
;; Interactive commands:
;;
;; The `org-visibility-mode' function toggles the minor mode on and off. For
;; normal use, turn it on when `org-mode' is enabled.
;;
;; The `org-visibility-save' function saves the current buffer's file
;; visibility state if it has been modified or had an `org-cycle' change, and
;; matches the above Qualification Rules.
;;
;; The `org-visibility-force-save' function saves the current buffer's file
;; visibility state if it matches the above Qualification Rules, regardless of
;; whether the file has been modified.
;;
;; The `org-visibility-save-all-buffers' function saves the visibility state
;; for any modified buffer files that match the above Qualification Rules.
;;
;; The `org-visibility-load' function loads a file and restores its visibility
;; state if it matches the above Qualification Rules.
;;
;; The `org-visibility-remove' function removes a given file (or the current
;; buffer's file) from `org-visibility-state-file'.
;;
;; The `org-visibility-clean' function removes all missing or untracked files
;; from `org-visibility-state-file'.
